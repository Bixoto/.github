Bixoto is a remote European company with a heavy focus on technology looking to make e-commerce more sustainable and
less impersonal.

We rely a lot on free and open-source software and believe that the more we share code in the open the more we can
improve the overall quality of software by having the community collaborate on common projects instead of having
multiple independent closed-source implementations. For this reason we open-source most of our non-specific code and
encourage contributions to FOSS projects.

We are open to new technologies. We currently use Python, PHP, JS (Svelte and Vue), Ansible and Docker (with [Dokku][]).
